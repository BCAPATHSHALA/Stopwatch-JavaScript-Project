## Features

- Start: Initiates the stopwatch, allowing it to count time.
- Stop: Pauses the stopwatch, halting the time count.
- Reset: Resets the stopwatch to zero, clearing any recorded time.
- Display: Shows the elapsed time in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/local-watch.git

   ```

- Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## How it Works
The stopwatch leverages the `setInterval` method to update the elapsed time every millisecond. The `clearInterval` method is used to pause the timer. The time is displayed on the interface by manipulating the DOM.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
